# mlvd-bettersplittnl
**⚠️ you will need Mullvad installed ⚠️**<BR><BR>
a script that replace the bad split tunneling function on linux, using Mullvad CLI and bash

did this because i dont wanna use the other methods that are very shitty

for the moment you can basically add a line to the EXCLUDED_APPS variable on the script and run it, it refresh itselfs until you stop it

**if you want to clean the split-tunneling, do:**
```bash
mullvad split-tunnel clear
```
